    <h4><b>Rent control</b> is effective at keeping people in their homes. 
      Rent control policies limit rent increases and provide greater housing stability for tenants. 
      Rent control ordinances in California allow landlords to set the initial rent in any amount, 
      but limit rent increases after a tenancy begins. </h4>
    <h4>Rent control is often combined with eviction protections, known as 
      <b>"just cause for eviction,"</b> to make sure that landlords do not get around
      the rent increase limits by simply evicting tenants arbitrarily and bringing in new tenants. 
      Just Cause protections provide basic fairness and prevent retaliation, discrimination, and harassment proactively.</h4>

      Just registration fee:
      Owners can, with proper advance 30-day notice, pass on to tenants half of the City’s 
      registration fee for the Rent Stabilization Program. In program years 2011 through 2015, 
      the tenant’s share of this fee is $9.75 per month. Tenants cannot be charged more than this 
      amount or charged this fee retroactively. This fee is not part of the rent or included in the
      calculation of the MAR or rent increases based on AGAs. The City’s fee is in addition to the 
      rent and helps cover the cost of administering the Ordinance.
 </p><p>
      A landlord cannot increase rent unless a Certificate of Maximum Allowable Rent has been issued
      for the current tenant of a regulated unit after a landlord has submitted a Registration Statement. 
      Once a Certificate of Maximum Allowable Rent has been issued, the landlord can raise that tenant’s 
      rent once every 12 months, but not in excess of 10% annually, as long as the unit continues to be 
      properly registered, and the landlord is in substantial compliance with the Ordinance. No rent 
      increases are permitted for tenants within 12 months of initial occupancy.
